1)Reason to Choose these Project-: Netflix is great OTP platform, I wanted to analysis the data to give a msg tp Directors and to the cast

2)Pandas Methods which are used in these project-: *info(),sum() ,duplicated(),value_counts(),nlargest() ,isna() ,groupby() ,idxmax(),nlargest() ,unique()

3)Graph which are used-: ->For plotting i have used 

matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn
Bar graph
Countplot
Heat map

4)Workdone-:

*By using duplicated i have removed the dulicates values from data set

*By using value_counts i got a name and the count of players who got player of the match ,same as teams also and i use it in Graphs also

*By using idxmax  i got the top i.e highest of the columns,were i have used at counting the min of shows.

*I used nlargest because by dataset is very big to visualize the data properly on the following graph i have drawn the top (n) shows using it.

*I used groupby where i need the reference of some other column.

*I have used unique method to neglect the copies

*I used countplot where the data is more and to visualize it properly.

5)Conclusion-: *--->From above Netflix alnalysis data
